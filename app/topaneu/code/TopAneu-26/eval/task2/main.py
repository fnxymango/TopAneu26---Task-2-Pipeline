"""
The following is a simple example evaluation method.

It is meant to run within a container. Its steps are as follows:

  1. Read the algorithm output
  2. Associate original algorithm inputs with a ground truths via predictions.json
  3. Calculate metrics by comparing the algorithm output to the ground truth
  4. Repeat for all algorithm jobs that ran for this submission
  5. Aggregate the calculated metrics
  6. Save the metrics to metrics.json

To run it locally, you can call the following bash script:

  ./do_test_run.sh

This will start the evaluation and reads from ./test/input and writes to ./test/output

To save the container and prep it for upload to Grand-Challenge.org you can call:

  ./do_save.sh

Any container that shows the same behaviour will do, this is purely an example of how one COULD do it.

Reference the documentation to get details on the runtime environment on the platform:
https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/runtime-environment/

Happy programming!
