"""
The following is a simple example evaluation method.

You can run the evaluation locally outside of Docker environment.
Outside of Docker, by default, main.py looks for files to evaluate in the current directory:
in ./predictions/ and ./ground-truth/
You can override this with any folder containing `ground-truth/` and `predictions/` sub-folders.
The naming of gt and pred files can be arbitrary as long as their filenames are sorted in the same order.

python3 main.py --base_path <parent_dir_of_gt_pred_subdirs>

When run within a container. Its steps are as follows:

  1. Read the algorithm output
  2. Associate original algorithm inputs with a ground truths via predictions.json
  3. Calculate metrics by comparing the algorithm output to the ground truth
  4. Repeat for all algorithm jobs that ran for this submission
  5. Aggregate the calculated metrics
  6. Save the metrics to metrics.json

(for organizers) Test for Docker environment
  ./do_test_run.sh

(for organizers) To save the container and prep it for upload to Grand-Challenge.org you can call:
  ./do_save.sh

Any container that shows the same behaviour will do, this is purely an example of how one COULD do it.

Reference the documentation to get details on the runtime environment on the platform:
https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/runtime-environment/

Happy programming!
